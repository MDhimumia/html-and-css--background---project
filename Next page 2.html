        <P>Diego Armando Maradona is by many considered as the greatest football player of all time. The Argentinian “number ten” became its nations savior then helping his team to a World Cup triumph in 1986. It was the second victory in World Cup for Argentina and it would never had happened without Maradona.</P>
        <p>Maradona have become a living legend and the title as “the best player ever” was often split – depending on preferences – by him and Pelé. Several Argentinian players have now and when been hailed as “the new Maradona”, such as Ariel Ortega and Aymar. But not until a certain Lionel Messi arrived to the planet of soccer, there have never been any on an equal level.</p>

        <p>The discussion about who the best player is has progressed along with Messi’s development as a footballer. The arguments that Maradona is the better of the both players can be made on such facts that he did both Argentina and Napoli to champions. Messi have not won the World Cup with his national team and FC Barcelona was already the domestic champions then he arrived. The arguments could of course consider many more aspects, the football journalist Jonathan Wilson writes about Maradona: "It wasn't just about his technical ability, about his gambetas, his free kicks, and his goals, but about him as an inspiration and an organizer. Of the other greats, perhaps only Cruyff -- although in a different way -- could match his on-field tactical brain".</p>
